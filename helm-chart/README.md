# Kubernetes Mutating Admission webhook HELM chart

## Using the chart:
- These charts are stored as releases and can be accessed through helm without the need for git credentials as it is public.
- Access the chart from the command line using `helm repo add mex-aws-token-injector "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrefectHQ/mex-aws-token-injector/gh-pages"`

## Build and Release
- The chart will be built automatically upon merge to main with changes in the `helm-chart` directory.
